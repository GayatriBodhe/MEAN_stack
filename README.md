# Practical Assignments MEAN Stack (SPPU)

## HTML, JavaScript, and AngularJS Assignments

1. Create an HTML form that contains the Student Registration details and write a JavaScript to validate the student's first and last name, ensuring it contains only alphabets. The age should be between 18 to 50.
2. Create an HTML form that contains the Employee Registration details and write a JavaScript to validate Date of Birth (DOB), Joining Date, and Salary.
3. Create an HTML form for Login and write a JavaScript to validate the email ID using a Regular Expression.
4. Write an AngularJS script using the `ng-click` directive to display an alert message after clicking an element.
5. Write an AngularJS script to add two numbers using `ng-init`, `ng-model`, and `ng-bind`. Demonstrate `ng-show`, `ng-disabled`, and `ng-click` directives on a button component.
6. Using AngularJS, display the 10 student details in Table format using `ng-repeat` directive (use an array to store data).
7. Using AngularJS, create a Single Page Application (SPA) to show the syllabus content of all subjects of MSC(CS) Sem II (use `ng-view`).
8. Using AngularJS, create a SPA to accept user details such as name, mobile number, pincode, and email address, and validate them:
   - Name should contain only characters.
   - Mobile number should be exactly 10 digits.
   - Pincode should be exactly 6 digits.
   - Email should contain exactly one `@` and one `.` symbol.
9. Using AngularJS, create a SPA for a Login System.
10. Create an HTML form using AngularJS that contains Student Registration details and validate first and last names to contain only alphabets. The age should be between 18 to 50. Display a greeting message depending on the entered name using `ng-show` (e.g., "Good Morning", "Good Afternoon", etc.). Use AJAX.
11. Create an AngularJS application that shows the current Date and Time of the system using the Interval Service.
12. Using AngularJS, create a SPA to validate a username entered in a textbox:
   - If empty, show an alert `"Enter Username"`.
   - If the length is less than 3, show `"Username is too short"`.
   - If valid, display `"Valid Username"` (minimum 8 characters required).
13. Create an AngularJS application that shows the location of the current web page.

## Node.js Assignments

14. Create a Node.js file that converts the output `"Hello World!"` into uppercase letters.
15. Using Node.js, create a web page that reads two file names from the user and appends the content of the first file into the second file.
16. Create a Node.js file that opens a requested file and returns the content to the client. If anything goes wrong, throw a 404 error.
17. Create a Node.js file that writes an HTML form with an upload field.
18. Create a Node.js file that demonstrates creating a database and a table in MySQL.
19. Create a Node.js file that selects all records from the `"customers"` table and displays the result object on the console.
20. Create a Node.js file that inserts multiple records in the `"student"` table and displays the result object on the console.
21. Create a Node.js file that selects all records from the `"customers"` table and deletes the specified record.
22. Create a simple web server using Node.js.
23. Using Node.js, create a User Login System.
24. Using Node.js, create an eLearning System.
25. Using Node.js, create a Recipe Book.
26. Write a Node.js script to interact with the file system and serve a web page from a file.
27. Write a Node.js script to build your own Node.js module. Use `require("http")` to invoke HTTP module functionality. Create a `.txt` file containing the word `"modules.js"` and add this function to return the file content.
28. Write a `main.js` file for event-driven application handling:
   - Define an event named `"myEvent"`.
   - Attach a callback function when the event is triggered.
29. Using Node.js, create a program that transfers a file as an attachment on the web and enables browsers to download it using `express.js`.
